# Cosine & dot product

Let's take the cosine rule
from algebra, which you'll remember
probably, vaguely from school. I might have said, if
we had a triangle with sides a, b, and c, then what the cosine rule
said was that c squared was equal to a squared plus b
squared minus 2ab times the cos of
the angle between a and b, cos that angle theta there. Now, we can translate that
into a vector notation. We call this vector r here, and we call this vector s here. Then this vector will
be minus s plus r, so that vector will be r minus s, minus s plus r. So
we can say that c squared was the modulus
of r minus s squared, and that would be
equal to the modulus, the size of r squared plus
the size of s squared minus 2 mod r mod s cos theta. Now, here's the cool bit. We can multiply this out
using our dot-product, because we know that
the size of r minus s squared is equal to r minus
s dotted with itself. Now, that's just that, and we can multiply
that out and then we'll compare it to
this right hand side here. So r minus s dotted
with r minus s. Well, that's going to be, if we need to figure out how to
multiply that out, that's going to be equal
to r dotted with r, and then take the next one,
minus s dotted with r, minus s dotted with r again, if you take minus s and that r. Minus s dotted with r again, and then minus s dotted
with minus s. So that is, we've got the modulus
of r squared here, and we dot r with itself, minus twice s dotted with r, and then minus s dotted
with minus s. Well, that's going to be the size of minus s squared which is
just the size of s square. Then we can compare that
to the right-hand side. When we do that comparison, compare that to
the right-hand side, the minus r squareds
are going to cancel, the r squareds even, the s squareds are
going to cancel. So we get a result which is that minus twice s dotted with r, is equal to minus
twice modulus of r, modulus of s, cos theta. That is, and then we can
lose the minus sign, minus signs will cancel out just multiply
through by minus 1. Then the 2s we can
cancel out again. So we can say that
the dot-product r.s, just to put it in
a more familiar form is equal to mod r mod s cos theta. So what we found here is that the dot
product really does something quite profound, it takes the size
of the two vectors. If these were both unit
length vectors those will be 1 and multiplies by cos of
the angle between them. It tells us something
about the extent to which the two vectors go in
the same direction, because if theta was 0
then cos theta would be 1, and r.s would just be the size of the two vectors
multiplied together. If the two vectors on
the other hand we're at 90 degrees to each
other, if they were, r was like this and s was like this and
the angle between them, theta, was equal to 90 degrees, cos theta, cos 90 is 0, and then r.s is going to be, we can immediately see, r.s is going to be
some size of r, some size of s, times 0. So if the two vectors are pointing at 90 degrees
to each other, if they what's called
orthogonal to each other, then the dot product
it's going to give me 0. If they're both pointed
in the same direction, so s was like that and the angle
between them is nought. Cos of nought is equal to 1, and then r.s is equal to
the mod r times mod s, just the multiplication of
the two sizes together. Fun one, last fun one here, is that r and s are in
opposite directions. So let's say s was
now going this way, and the angle between them
was a 180 degrees cos of 180, 180 degrees is equal to minus 1. So then, r.s will
be equal to minus the size of r times
the size of s. So what the dot product here
really does with this cos, it tells us when we get the minus sign out
that they're going in opposite directions. So there's some property
here in the dot product, we've derived by looking
at the cosine rule, that we've derived here, when the dot product's 0 they are 90 degrees
to each other, they're orthogonal,
when they go in the same way we get
a positive answer, when they're going more or
less in opposite directions we get a negative answer
for the dot product.
