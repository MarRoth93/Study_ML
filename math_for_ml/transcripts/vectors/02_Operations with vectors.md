# Operations with vectors

So, we have these things called vectors like this guy here. What we want to do first is get an idea of what makes a vector, a vector. What we'll do in this video is explore the operations we can do with vectors, the sort of things that we can do with them that define what they are, and the sort of spaces they can apply to. So, a vector, we can think of as an object that moves us about space like this guy here. This could be a physical space, or a space of data. At school, you probably thought of a vector as something that moved you around a physical space, but in computer and data science, we generalise that idea to think of a vector as maybe just a list of attributes of an object. So, we might think of a house, say, so here's a house, and this might have a number of attributes, we could say it was 120 square metres in floor area, it might have two bedrooms, say, it might have one bathroom, that would be sort of sensible, and it might be worth 150,000 Euros, say. And I could write that down as the vector, 120 square metres, 2 bedrooms, 1 bathroom, and 150,000 Euros. While in physics, we think of this as being a thing that moves us about space, in data science, we think of this vector as being a thing that describes the object of a house. So, we've generalized the idea of moving about space to include the description of the attributes of an object. Now, a vector is just something that are based on two rules. Firstly, addition, and secondly, multiplication by a scalar number. We'll do this first, think of a vector as just a geometric object starting at the origin, so something like this. So we get a vector, r, there. Vector addition is then when we just take another vector, so let's take another vector like this guy here, let's call him, s, and where we put s on the end of r. So then, that's s, and therefore, if we put s on the end of r, we get a sum that's r then going along s. We call that guy r plus s. Now, we could do this the other way round. We could do s and then r, and we'd get to the same point. So r plus s is equal to s plus r. So, vector addition is what's called commutative. It doesn't matter which way round you do it. The other thing we can do with a vector is we can multiply it by a scalar number. So, we could take our vector r, and we could multiply it by two, say. So, we could have two lots of r, which would just be a vector that was twice as long in the same direction. Or, we could multiply it by minus one, and we'd get a vector that was in the opposite direction of the same length. So, we can scale our vectors by multiplying them by a scalar number. And that's all a vector is. It's an object that can be added to another vector, and can be multiplied by a scalar number. And that's it. Those are the only two rules that a vector has to obey.
