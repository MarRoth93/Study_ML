prompt = """
You are working in a local project directory.

Your task is:
1. Find all `.txt` files in the current directory.
2. For each one, create a corresponding `.md` file with the same filename (but ending in `.md`).
3. Copy the content **exactly as-is** â€” do not summarize, reword, or skip anything.
4. Format each Markdown file as follows:
   - Use the original filename as the H1 title: `# filename.txt`
   - Put the entire file content inside a fenced code block (```)

5. **Important:** Never delete or change the original `.txt` files.
