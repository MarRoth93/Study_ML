Now, let's look at how we
do the transformation of a vector that's already
in a change basis. Last time, we looked
at bears basis. Bears basis had
a first axis of three, one and a second axis
of one, one. Let's say I have a vector x, y defined in bears basis. As I want to transform
it by doing something like a rotation of 45 degrees. But the problem is, I
don't know how to write a 45 degree rotation in bears
funny coordinate system. I only know how to write down a 45 degree rotation
in my normal 1, 0, 0, 1 system. So in my system which is 1, 0, 0, 1 a 45 degree
rotation rotates 1, 0 up like that. So if it's still
a unit vector at 1, 0 over root 2, 1, over root 2, that is a normalized 1, 1. It takes 0, 1 round to
minus 1 over root 2, 1 over root 2. That is that 45 degrees there, that 45 degrees there. So I can write it down
the rotation in my notation. Let's call it R being
a 45 degree rotation, as being 1 over root 2 times 1, 1 minus 1, 1. That's what a 45 degree
rotation is in my world. So what I need to do is first
transform the vector x, y into my basis. I do that by multiplying it by B. Then I can apply my nice sensible rotation R to that vector that's
now in my basis. So what I get here when I do B, I've got the vector in
my coordinate frame. Now the problem is bear
doesn't care about my world, he wants to get
the rotation in his basis. So then I have to transform
the resulting vector, back into bears basis. I do that by applying
B to the minus 1. B to the minus 1, I get by flipping the terms on
the leading diagonal, taking minus
the off-diagonal terms, and dividing by
the determinant here which is 2 so I
multiply it by a half. So that then gives me, the vector back in bears frame. So overall what I've done, is I've done B to
the minus 1 times R, times B. What that's giving me, is it's given me the rotation, in bears coordinate system.
Which is really neat. So now what we have
to do is do the sums. When we do that R,
B gives us this, and B to the -1 RB gives us this. I've written them down there,
so pause and ponder if you want to verify
those on your own. So this is what a 45 degree rotation looks like in bears coordinate system. Notice that it's completely different to the one
in my standard basis. It isn't very easy necessarily or obvious to
intuit just out of your head, you have to do the calculation. So if you want to
do some translation but in some funny basis, this equation B to
the minus 1 RB, is going to be very useful. To step back here, the point
is that if we want to transform to normal form
normal coordinate systems, then the translation
matrices also change. We have to be mindful of that. This is the algebra
you see all the time. We've got the
transformation matrix R, wrapped around by B, B is the minus 1, that does the translation from my world to the world of
the new basis system. So thanks a lot bear, you really helped us out to
understand all this stuff. So what we've done in these
two videos is we've looked at how the numbers in
a vector change, where we change the basis. We thought about the coordinate
systems and how to do transformations in non-orthogonal
coordinate systems. It's been quite hard work, but this really sets us up for example in principal
component analysis, to operate in
different basis systems.
