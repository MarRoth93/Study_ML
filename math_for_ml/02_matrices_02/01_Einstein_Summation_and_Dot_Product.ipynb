    "## Understanding Index Notation and Einstein's Brilliant Shortcut\n",
    "\n",
    "### Traditional Index Notation\n",
    "In linear algebra, we often need to specify exactly which element of a matrix we're talking about:\n",
    "- For a matrix **A**, we write **A_{ij}** where **i = row index** and **j = column index**\n",
    "- Python equivalent: `A[i, j]`\n",
    "\n",
    "### Matrix Multiplication the Long Way\n",
    "When we multiply two matrices C = AB, each element of the result is computed as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$C_{ik} = \\sum_{j=1}^{n} A_{ij} \\cdot B_{jk}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This means: \"To get element (i,k) of C, multiply corresponding elements from row i of A and column k of B, then sum them all up.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "### Einstein's Genius Insight\n",
    "Einstein noticed that writing the summation symbol (Σ) over and over was redundant. He introduced this rule:\n",
    "\n",
    "> **When an index appears exactly twice in a term, we automatically sum over it.**\n",
    "\n",
    "So instead of writing:  $$C_{ik} = \\sum_{j} A_{ij} B_{jk}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "We simply write:  $$C_{ik} = A_{ij} B_{jk}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The index **j** appears twice (once in each matrix), so we sum over it. The indices **i** and **k** appear once each, so they remain as free indices determining the output shape.\n",

    "\n",
    "### Batch Operations\n",
    "In machine learning, we often work with **batches** of data—multiple examples processed simultaneously. Einstein notation shines here:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Batch matrix multiplication: (batch_size, m, n) @ (batch_size, n, p) → (batch_size, m, p)\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The `b` index represents the batch dimension and stays in the output, while `n` is summed over.\n",

    "\n",
    "1. **Neural Network Forward Pass**\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   # Input batch (batch_size, input_dim) @ weights (input_dim, output_dim)\n",
    "   np.einsum('bi,io->bo', inputs, weights)\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Attention Mechanism (Simplified)**\n",

    "   # Query-Key attention: (seq_len, d_model) @ (seq_len, d_model) → (seq_len, seq_len)\n",
    "   np.einsum('qd,kd->qk', queries, keys)\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Convolution-like Operations**\n",
