    "**The Big Picture:** Imagine you and your friend are describing the location of a coffee shop. You use street addresses (north-south, east-west), but your friend uses landmarks (\"2 blocks from the library, 1 block from the park\"). You're both describing the same location, just using different **coordinate systems** or **bases**.\n",
    "\n",
    "In linear algebra, changing basis means converting vector coordinates from one coordinate system to another. This is fundamental to computer graphics, robotics, data analysis, and machine learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Goal:** Learn how to transform vectors between bases using **change-of-basis matrices**, understand the role of the **inverse**, and see why **dot products (projections)** only recover coordinates directly in **orthonormal** bases.\n",

    "We'll work through two concrete examples:\n",
    "1. A general (non-orthogonal) basis where we must use a matrix inverse\n",
    "2. An orthonormal basis where the inverse equals the transpose and dot-product projections give coordinates directly\n",

    "- Represent a basis as a **matrix with basis vectors as columns**\n",
    "- Convert a vector from coordinates in one basis to another using **matrix multiplication**\n",
    "- Compute the **reverse transformation** via the **inverse**\n",
    "- Explain when and why **projections** (dot products) recover coordinates\n",
