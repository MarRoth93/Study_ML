    "# Reflection in an Arbitrary Plane — A Worked Example\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is Reflection?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Reflection** is a geometric transformation that \"flips\" vectors across a plane (or line in 2D). Imagine holding a vector up to a mirror placed at the plane—the reflection is what you see in the mirror.\n",
    "\n",
    "Key properties of reflection:\n",
    "- Vectors **in the plane** remain unchanged (they're on the mirror surface)\n",
    "- Vectors **perpendicular to the plane** get flipped to point in the opposite direction\n",
    "- The distance from any point to the plane equals the distance from its reflection to the plane\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Mathematical Challenge\n",
    "\n",
    "While reflecting across coordinate planes (like the xy-plane) is straightforward, reflecting across an **arbitrary plane** requires careful coordinate transformations. We'll solve this by:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Finding an orthonormal basis** where the plane alignment is clear\n",
    "2. **Performing the reflection** in this convenient coordinate system\n",
    "3. **Transforming back** to the original coordinates\n",
    "\n",
    "## Problem Setup\n",
    "\n",
    "**Given:**  \n",
    "- Two vectors in the plane: $v_1=(1,1,1)$, $v_2=(2,0,1)$  \n",
    "- A third vector pointing out of the plane: $v_3=(3,1,-1)$  \n",
    "- A vector to reflect: $r=(2,3,5)$\n",
    "\n",
    "**Our Strategy:**  \n",
    "1. Build an **orthonormal basis** $E=[e_1\\ e_2\\ e_3]$ where $e_1,e_2$ span the plane and $e_3$ is its normal (via Gram–Schmidt)\n",
    "2. In the $E$-coordinates, reflection across the plane is simply:  \n",
    "   $$T_E = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & -1 \\end{pmatrix}$$  \n",
    "3. Convert back to standard coordinates with $T = E\\,T_E\\,E^T$\n",
    "4. Apply to $r$ and verify the result"

    "## The Key Insight: Change of Basis\n",
    "\n",
    "The secret to reflecting across an arbitrary plane is to **change our perspective**. Instead of working in the standard $x,y,z$ coordinates, we'll create a new coordinate system where:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The first two basis vectors ($e_1, e_2$) lie **in the plane**\n",
    "- The third basis vector ($e_3$) is **perpendicular to the plane** (the normal vector)\n",
    "\n",
    "In this new coordinate system, reflection becomes trivial:\n",
    "- Keep the first two coordinates unchanged (in-plane components)\n",
    "- Flip the sign of the third coordinate (normal component)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Analogy:** It's like rotating a tilted mirror until it's horizontal, performing an easy reflection, then rotating everything back to the original orientation."

    "## 📚 Summary and Key Takeaways\n",
    "\n",
    "### What We Accomplished\n",
    "- ✅ Built an **orthonormal basis** $E$ for an arbitrary plane using Gram–Schmidt\n",
    "- ✅ Applied the **change of basis** technique to simplify reflection  \n",
    "- ✅ Calculated the reflection matrix: $T = E \\, \\text{diag}(1,1,-1) \\, E^T$\n",
    "- ✅ Successfully reflected vector $r = (2,3,5)$ to get $r' = \\frac{1}{3}(11,14,5)$\n",
    "- ✅ Verified our result through multiple geometric checks\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Big Picture: Why This Matters\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. Change of Basis is Powerful**  \n",
    "By choosing the right coordinate system, complex problems become simple. This principle appears throughout linear algebra and beyond.\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. Orthonormal Bases Simplify Everything**  \n",
    "When basis vectors are orthonormal, coordinate transformations become clean and intuitive. The matrix $E$ has the special property $E^{-1} = E^T$.\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. Geometric Intuition Guides Algebra**  \n",
    "Understanding that reflection \"keeps in-plane components, flips normal component\" led us directly to the matrix $\\text{diag}(1,1,-1)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Connections to Other Topics\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Computer Graphics**: Reflections are fundamental for lighting, mirrors, and special effects\n",
    "- **Physics**: Reflection symmetries appear in optics, crystallography, and particle physics  \n",
    "- **Signal Processing**: Reflection operations are used in wavelets and image processing\n",
    "- **Group Theory**: Reflections form mathematical groups with rich algebraic structure\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Mathematical Journey\n",
    "```\n",
    "Arbitrary Plane → Gram-Schmidt → Orthonormal Basis → Simple Reflection → Transform Back\n",
    "    (Complex)         (Process)        (Clean coords)       (Easy matrix)      (Final result)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This workflow—**simplify through change of basis, solve, then transform back**—is a fundamental strategy that extends far beyond reflections to eigenvalue problems, differential equations, and many other areas of mathematics."
