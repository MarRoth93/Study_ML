# Codebase Summary

## Project Summary

This project comprises a collection of Python utility scripts designed to support a series of machine learning labs, likely within a Jupyter Notebook environment. The scripts provide functions for creating interactive plots, running tests, and other common utilities needed for the exercises.

## High-level Architecture

The codebase is structured as a set of utility modules. There is no central application or a single entry point. Each file provides specific functionality that can be imported and used in other scripts or notebooks. The primary purpose is to support the educational content of the labs.

## Dependencies

Based on the imports, the main dependencies are:
- `numpy`
- `matplotlib`
- `ipywidgets`

## Entry Points

There are no explicit command-line entry points (e.g., `if __name__ == "__main__":`) in these files. They are intended to be imported as modules into other scripts or notebooks.

## Per-File Synopsis

### `utils.py`
- **Purpose:** Provides core utility functions for the labs, including loading data and feature mapping.
- **Key Functions/Classes:**
    - `load_data()`: Loads data from a text file.
    - `map_feature()`: Creates polynomial features from the original features.
    - `plot_data()`: Plots the dataset.
    - `plot_decision_boundary()`: Plots the decision boundary of a classifier.

### `test_utils.py`
- **Purpose:** Contains utility functions for running tests.
- **Key Functions/Classes:**
    - `unittest.TestCase`: This file uses the `unittest` framework to define test cases.
    - Test classes for various labs, such as `TestC1W3`.

### `public_tests.py`
- **Purpose:** Contains the public test cases for the lab exercises.
- **Key Functions/Classes:**
    - Defines test cases for the functions implemented by the user in the labs, such as `sigmoid_test`, `compute_cost_test`, etc.

### `plt_quad_logistic.py`
- **Purpose:** Provides functions for plotting related to quadratic logistic regression.
- **Key Functions/Classes:**
    - `plt_quad_logistic()`: Creates an interactive plot for quadratic logistic regression.

### `plt_overfit.py`
- **Purpose:** Provides functions for creating interactive plots to demonstrate the concept of overfitting.
- **Key Functions/Classes:**
    - `overfit_example()`: An interactive plot to explore overfitting.

### `plt_one_addpt_onclick.py`
- **Purpose:** Provides functions for creating interactive plots where the user can add data points by clicking.
- **Key Functions/Classes:**
    - `plt_one_addpt_onclick()`: An interactive plot that allows adding data points.

### `plt_logistic_loss.py`
- **Purpose:** Provides functions for plotting the logistic loss function.
- **Key Functions/Classes:**
    - `plt_logistic_cost()`: Plots the cost function for logistic regression.
    - `plt_two_logistic_loss_curves()`: Plots the two curves of the logistic loss function.

### `lab_utils_common.py`
- **Purpose:** Provides common utility functions used across the labs.
- **Key Functions/Classes:**
    - `dlc`: A dictionary of colors for plotting.
    - `plot_data()`: A function to plot the data.
    - `sigmoid()`: The sigmoid function.
    - `compute_cost_logistic()`: Computes the cost for logistic regression.

## Tests

- **`public_tests.py`**: This file contains the public test cases that are used to evaluate the correctness of the user's implementations in the labs.
- **`test_utils.py`**: This file provides utility functions and classes for running the tests, using the `unittest` framework.

## Quickstart / How to Run

The scripts in this project are not meant to be run directly. They are designed to be imported and used within the Jupyter Notebooks that constitute the lab exercises. To run the code, you would typically open one of the `.ipynb` files and execute the cells in order.
