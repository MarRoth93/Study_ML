# Study_ML

This repository collects short notebooks and examples created while reinforcing my understanding of machine learning and deep learning. Each directory focuses on a specific topic and new notebooks will be added as I learn more.

## Repository structure

### `math_for_ml`
Introductory mathematics used in machine learning. The notebooks have been reorganised into themed subfolders:

#### `01_vectors`
- **01_vector_operations.ipynb** – Walkthrough of fundamental vector math with NumPy. Covers vector definitions, addition, subtraction and scalar multiplication with small practical examples.
- **02_modulus_and_inner_product.ipynb** – Explores vector modulus (magnitude) and the inner (dot) product using NumPy and Matplotlib visualisations.
- **03_vector_projections.ipynb** – Connects the cosine rule with the dot product, offering geometric intuition.
- **04_vector_projections.ipynb** – Detailed explanation of scalar and vector projections with practical examples.
- **05_changing_basis.ipynb** – Demonstrates how to change coordinate bases using dot products and projections.
- **06_basis_space_independence.ipynb** – Introduces vector spaces, linear independence and span with practical ML links.
- **07_application_of_changing_basis.ipynb** – Applies basis changes in small numerical examples.

#### `02_matrices`
- **09_Matrices_and_vectors.ipynb** – First look at matrices and how they interact with vectors.

### `supervised_learning`
Experiments with classical regression algorithms using scikit‑learn.

- **01_basic_regression.ipynb** – Generates synthetic data and trains a linear regression model. Demonstrates baseline evaluation, pipeline construction, regularisation with `Ridge`, cross‑validation and bias–variance analysis.

### `Eeg_analysis` and `Fmri_analysis`
Placeholders for future notebooks exploring EEG and fMRI data.
