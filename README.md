# Study_ML

This repository collects short notebooks and examples created while reinforcing my understanding of machine learning and deep learning.  Each directory focuses on a specific topic and new notebooks will be added as I learn more.

## Repository structure

### `math_for_ml`
Introductory mathematics used in machine learning.

- **01_vector_operations.ipynb** – Walkthrough of fundamental vector math with NumPy.  Covers vector definitions, addition, subtraction and scalar multiplication, along with small practical examples.
- **02_modulus_and:inner_product.ipynb** – Explores vector modulus (magnitude) and the inner (dot) product using NumPy and Matplotlib visualizations.

### `supervised_learning`
Experiments with classical regression algorithms using scikit‑learn.

- **01_basic_regression.ipynb** – Generates synthetic data and trains a linear regression model.  Demonstrates baseline evaluation, pipeline construction, regularization with `Ridge`, cross‑validation and bias–variance analysis.
